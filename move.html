           <h3>&emsp;The apparent motion of the sun, caused by the rotation of the Earth about its axis. As the Earth rotates around the sun on its annual cycle, it is tilted at an angle on its vertical axis. In here, changes the angle at which the direct component of light will strike the Earth. From a fixed location on Earth, the sun appears to move throughout the sky. The angle between the sun and a fixed location on Earth depends on the particular location (the longitude of the location), the time of year and the time of day.

          &emsp;For complete modeling of the sun's angle to a fixed position on Earth requires the latitude, longitude, day of the year, and time of day.
          The Earth is its most extreme tilt at the winter and summer solstices.The bellow diagram compare the sun's path on the winter and summer solstices.

              In the winter, the sun is relatively low in the sky with its lowest arc through the sky on the winter solstice, on December 21st. In the summer, the sun travels a high path through the sky and is at its highest angle on the summer solstice, on June 21st. The highest arc represents the sun’s path on the summer solstice, while the shortest, lowest arc is the sun’s path on the winter solstice.
              The equinox falls on the point between the solstices and indicates the arrival of spring or fall. On each equinox, the sun travels a path that is right in the middle of the path that it travels on the solstices.

              <p style="text-align:justify; ">&emsp;The Sun crosses the celestial equator moving northward at the vernal equinox around March 21 and crosses the celestial equator moving southward at the autumnal equinox around September 21. When the Sun is on the celestial equator at the equinoxes, everybody on the Earth experiences 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of night for those two days. On those two days of the year, the Sun will rise in the exact east direction, follow an arc right along the celestial equator and set in the exact west direction.
              This video shows how to move the sun and important things about it.
