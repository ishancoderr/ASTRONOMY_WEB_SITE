            <p style="text-align:justify; "><h3>&emsp;Astronomy is defined as "The scientific study of the universe beyond the earth, especially the observation, calculation, and theoretical interpretation of the positions, dimensions,distribution, motion, composition, and evolution of celestial bodies and phenomena".Geodetic astronomy, on the other hand, is described as the art and science for determining, by astronomical observations, the positions of points on the earth and the azimuths of the geodetic linesconnecting such points.</p> 
                            <p style="text-align:justify; ">&emsp;
              Astronomy is the oldest of the natural sciences dating back to ancient Chinese and Babylonian civilizations. Prior to 1609, when the telescope was invented, the naked eye was used for measurements. When referring to its use in surveying, the terms practical or positional astronomy are often used. The fundamental concepts and basic principles of "spherical astronomy", which is the basis for geodetic astronomy, were developed principally by the Greeks, and were well established by the 2nd century A.D.

               The geographic latitude of a point is an acute an angle between the direction of the gravitation force in this point and any place that cuts the axis of rotation of the earth at right angle the meridian plane of a point is the one that passes through the direction of gravitation force in this point and is parallel to the axis of rotation.</p>
                            <p style="text-align:justify; ">&emsp; 
              From the above important facts follows that the determination of geographic latitude and longitude of a point on earth does not mean the determination of its position considering that the earth is a geoid . The geographic latitude and longitude of this point only the determine the position of the tangent to the vertical in this point. </p>
              <p style="text-align:justify; ">&emsp;
              The subject geodetic astronomy must be an essential part in the education of every engineer of geodesy ,if it is desired this engineer to be capable of working in all fields of his profession including research.</p>
